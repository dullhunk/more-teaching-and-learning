# What's the Story, Learning Glory?

Students stories about what they have learned, the teaching they receive and research they are exposed to are a key part of the story of any University. At the University of Manchester, these stories describe the difference the organisation makes in local, national and international communities through its footprint of:
* [40,000 students, studying over 1,000 different degree programmes](https://www.employers.manchester.ac.uk/ourstudents/) 
* [12,800 staff, including almost 7,000 academic and research staff](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/)

What are the most important stories that students and staff tell about their learning, teaching and research?

## The Stories from Staff in Media Relations

How do these stories reflect the values and purpose of the University, as told in press releases from its staff in the [media relations team](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/contact-media-relations/)? We counted the occurrences of keywords in ten years worth of annual press releases from 2015 to 2024. The table below shows an analysis of the frequency of keywords `STUDENT*`, `LEARN*`, `TEACH*` and `RESEARCH`. 

For example `LEARN*` = `learn`, `learning`, `learner` etc. The frequency of these words is shown below

## So What's the Story?

So, what's the story?

* With over 40,000 `students` studying at the University of Manchester, its not suprising to see the word `student` appear frequently
* As a `research` intensive Russell Group University, its not surprising to see the word research appear so frequently
* However, mentions of teaching and learning are much less frequent, about eight times less frequent than research (over a ten year period) and five times less frequent than student. This is disappointing for anyone involved in teaching and learning
* Speculate as to why this might be: no teaching? no learning? there is but its overlooked? teachers don't tell their stories, learners don't tell theirs?
