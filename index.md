# What's the story, learning glory?

There are plenty of stories we can tell about how teaching and learning have changed in higher education in the last three years. Unfortunately, these stories are either untold or overlooked. If Universities want to be better understood, they need be telling lots more stories about the learning they enable for the students that they teach, argues Duncan Hull.

## What's the story?

I counted the occurrences of keywords in five annual press releases that get emailed to the inbox of every member of staff at the end of each year. You can repeat this analysis on any University press release as follows:

1. Count the words that begin with LEARN* or TEACH*
1. Count the words with RESEARCH*
1. Calculate the ratio of the two numbers you've just counted

Here's the results for the University of Manchester from 2018 to 2022:

| Words / Year                         |       2018  |      2019   |     2020    |      2021    |     2022    |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |---------- |---------- |---------- |---------- |
| TEACH* or LEARN*              | 1               |2                |3                |0                |1                |

*PROBLEM NO. 2* Teachers don't tell their teaching and learning stories, so there is nothing for the communications team to overlook. 

We need to solve both these problems if we want niversities want to be better understood. They need be telling lots more stories about the learning they enable for the students that they teach.

So what's your story, learning glory?
