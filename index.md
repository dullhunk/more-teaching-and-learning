# What's the Story, Learning Glory?

Students stories about what they have learned, the teaching they receive and research they are exposed to are a key part of the story of any University. At the University of Manchester, these stories describe the difference the organisation makes locally, nationally and internationally through its communities of:

* [40,000 students, studying over 1,000 different degree programmes](https://www.employers.manchester.ac.uk/ourstudents/) 
* [12,800 staff, including almost 7,000 academic and research staff](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/people/)

What are the most important stories that students and staff tell about their learning, teaching and research?

<!-- ## Teaching Glory? not really-->

## The Stories from Staff in Media Relations

Staff in the [media relations team](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/contact-media-relations/) are employed to tell stories about the University. These stories are summarised each year in an informative annual review published in December and circulated to students, staff and the wider world. We analysed these stories by counting the occurrences of keywords in [ten years of reviews published from 2015 to 2024](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/995). 

Figure 1 below shows an analysis of the frequency of keywords `STUDENT*`, `LEARN*`, `TEACH*` and `RESEARCH`.  For example `LEARN*` = `learn`, `learning`, `learner` etc. The frequency of these words is measured in average occurences of the words per article over a ten year period.

## The Story in the Vision

Alongside the media relations story, there's more stories to  be found in the vision that [the vision](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/1008) that the University has for itself. These stories are based on three goals top level goals:

1. **RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY**:  “`The quality of our research will place us among the top 5 UK universities in the Research Excellence Framework`”
2. **TEACHING AND LEARNING**:  “`We will achieve a top quartile sector position for student satisfaction`”
3. **SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY**: “`We will measure our success against a portfolio of measures and quality marks of social, cultural, economic and environmental impact`”

These core values are illustrated in Figure 2, lightly adapted from the original version published in [the vision](https://github.com/dullhunk/cdyf/issues/1008).

## So, What IS the Story?

So, what is the story, learning glory? There are several possible stories to tell:

* With over 40,000 `students` studying at the University of Manchester, it is not suprising to see the word `student` appear frequently, on average more than 9 times in an annual review
* As a `research` intensive Russell Group University, it is not surprising to see the word `research` appear so frequently either, on average nearly 16 times in each annual review. This aligns closely with the vision the University has of itself and its core values
* There are lots of `students` and lots of `research`, but what happened to `teaching` and `learning`? Mentions of `teach` and `learn` are much less frequent, between ten and twenty times less frequent than `research`, when averaged over a ten year period. This is disappointing for anyone involved in teaching and learning. Is there a mismatch between the vision and the reality? 
* Why are core values not reflected better in annual reviews? How much of a mismatch exists between our words and our actions as a University? 
    + Could it be that not much teaching takes place?
    + Perhaps there isn't any learning going on? 
    + Are teaching and learning overlooked? 
    + Are they just undervalued or misunderstood?
    + Not considered newsworthy? Harder to quantify?
    + Difficult to find stories to write about? See examples at [blogs.manchester.ac.uk/itl](https://blogs.manchester.ac.uk/itl/)
    + It could be that learning isn't glamourous enough and therefore not what most readers are expected to be interested in?
    + Maybe learners are just not _telling_ their stories? Or they are too trivial and personal to merit any media attention?
    + Could teachers be too busy to tell and document their [pedagogical stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy)? See Reference [1]
    + Words like [scholarship](https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/umitl/resources/scholarship-toolkit/) are equally rare and `pedagog*` appears exactly zero times in a decade. 
    + Why is this? What is going on? Are we missing something?
* We'll leave these interesting questions as an exercise for the reader to answer. What do you think?
