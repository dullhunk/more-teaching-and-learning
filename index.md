## The Stories in the Press Releases

How do these stories reflect the values and purpose of the University, as told in press releases? We counted the occurrences of keywords in nearly a decades worth of annual press releases from 2015 to 2024. The table below shows an analysis of the frequency of keywords `student`, `learn`, `teach` and `research`. e.g. `LEARN*` = `learn`, `learning`, `learner` etc

## So What's the Story?

So, what's the story?

* With over 40,000 `students` studying at the University of Manchester, its not suprising to see the word `student` appear frequently
* As a `research` intensive Russell Group University, its not suprpising 
* However, mentions of teaching and learning are much less frequent, about eight times less frequent than research (over a ten year period) and five times less frequent than student. This is disappointing for anyone involved in teaching and learning
