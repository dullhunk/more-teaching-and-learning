# What's the Story, Learning Glory?

Like many Universities, stories about teaching, learning and research describe the difference that the University of Manchester makes in local, national and international communities. How do these stories reflect the values and purpose of the University, as told in press releases? We counted the occurrences of keywords in annual press releases from 2018 to 2024. The table below shows an analysis of the frequency of keywords `teach`, `learn`, `student` and `research`.
