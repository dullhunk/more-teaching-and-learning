# What's the Story, Learning Glory?

Like many Universities, teaching, learning and research are key stories that reflect values at the University of Manchester. How are these values reflected in the stories told in press releases from the University? We counted the occurrences of keywords in annual press releases from 2018 to 2024. Here's the results for the keywords `teach`, `learn`, `student` and `research`.

So where all the teaching and learning stories?

## Learning glory?

*PROBLEM NO.1*: Any stories that are being told are also being overlooked. Here is a small selection of overlooked stories from the University of Manchester between 2020 and 2023. NONE of them made it into press releases (annual or otherwise) from the media relations team.

* **Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence** (CATE) recognises and celebrates [collaborative work that has had a demonstrable impact on teaching and learning](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/awards/teaching-excellence-awards/collaborative-award-for-teaching-excellence)
    +  No CATE winners from Manchester yet as far as I can see

*PROBLEM NO. 2*: Teachers don't tell their teaching and learning stories, so there is nothing for the communications team to overlook in the first place.

We need to solve both of these problems. If Universities want to be better understood, they need be telling lots more stories about the learning they enable for the students that they teach.

So what's your story, learning glory?
